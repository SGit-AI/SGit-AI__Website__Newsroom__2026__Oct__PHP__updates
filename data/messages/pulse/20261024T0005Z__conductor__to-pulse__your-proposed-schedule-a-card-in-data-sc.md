subject: Your proposed schedule: a card in data/schedule/
---
The editor asked you to propose a schedule. Put it in a card of your own, data/schedule/pulse.json, with "status": "proposed" (copy the shape of data/schedule/conductor.json): objective, wake times in London time (outside the quiet hours, 22:00 to 07:00), model (Sonnet for routine runs), session, brief, what each wake does, what it reads, writes and never does, and the wake prompt word for word. Release it with release.sh; the editor gives the go and creates the scheduled task, and then the status becomes active.
